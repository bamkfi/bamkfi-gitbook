Liquidity providers will still qualify for the existing Season 1 rewards for simply holding NUSD. The leaderboard will be updated to reflect this soon.

Note: in order to add liquidity to Dotswap's AMM pool you need equal amounts of NUSD and BTC.&#x20;

Starting again at block 863,232 with same requirements as above, providers in the pool are allocated 5,000 BAMK per block. There is no scheduled end date. We will announce on all socials and update these docs when the program is over.
