# NUSD•NUSD•NUSD•NUSD

**The Runes token** [**NUSD•NUSD•NUSD•NUSD**](https://unisat.io/runes/detail/NUSD%E2%80%A2NUSD%E2%80%A2NUSD%E2%80%A2NUSD) **is currently the recommended version of NUSD.** The BRC-20 version [$NUSD](https://uniscan.cc/brc20/%24NUSD) can be traded but has limited support.

Initially, NUSD was pegged 1:1 with USD, with holders earning BAMK rewards every block during Season 1. Starting at block 872222, remaining BAMK rewards from Season 1 were auctioned off weekly with the proceeds being used to reward NUSD holders with native rebasing. The last rebasing raised the exchange rate to 1 NUSD = 1.087 USD.\
\
**NUSD will be rebased back to 1:1.** NUSD holders will receive an airdrop of NUSD accounting for the current premium at the time of airdrop. For example, if you hold 1000 NUSD and the current exchange rate is 1.087 USD/NUSD, you will receive airdrop of 87 NUSD.&#x20;

**Starting soon, NUSD liquidity providers will be allocated a majority portion of protocol yield.**
