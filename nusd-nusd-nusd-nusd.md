# NUSD•NUSD•NUSD•NUSD

The Runes token [NUSD•NUSD•NUSD•NUSD](https://unisat.io/runes/detail/NUSD%E2%80%A2NUSD%E2%80%A2NUSD%E2%80%A2NUSD) is currently the mostly widely supported and recommended version of NUSD.

Up until block 872222, NUSD was pegged 1:1 with USD with holders of NUSD during Season 1 earned [BAMK rewards](https://app.gitbook.com/o/lfo0cE7iXE4350nipACw/s/L5vd9Yc2g4BdL74C5OqN/~/changes/91/rewards/rewards-for-nusd-holders) every block.

Now, holders of NUSD are rewarded with native rebasing, with the allocated BAMK rewards from Season 1 being [auctioned](https://bamk.fi/auction) and NUSD rebased proportionally based on current TVL.
