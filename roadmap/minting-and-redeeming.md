# Minting & Redeeming

Bamkfi will open minting and redemptions for all onchain users.&#x20;

* Mint NUSD: deposit sUSDe to Bamkfi and receive the equivalent amount in NUSD
* Redeem NUSD: deposit NUSD to Bamkfi and receive the equivalent amount in sUSDe&#x20;

By reducing the barriers to minting and redeeming we open up opportunities for traders to arbitrage the peg, improving onchain liquidity for everyone.

## Phase 2

* Mint NUSD: deposit BTC to Bamkfi and receive the equivalent amount in NUSD
* Redeem NUSD: deposit NUSD to Bamkfi and receive the equivalent amount in BTC

Phase 2 minting and redemptions will also introduce variable incentives depending on whether the funding rate is positive or negative. See [Negative Funding Rate Mitigation](https://bamkfi.gitbook.io/bamkfi-docs/roadmap/negative-funding-rate-mitigation).
